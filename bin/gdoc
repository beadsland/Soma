: <<'DOCUMENTATION'

GitHub-friendly housekeeping for the ldoc documentation system for Lua.

When run, in a GitHub project folder, builds documentation as per
usual, then identifies which pages have seen no changes other than
an updated timestamp. GitHub is told ignore those timestamp-only
changes, because really, who cares.

We also run inline edits on all documentation files generated from
markdown source, fixing links that work when the file extension is
C<.md>, but not so much when the file extension is <.md.html>.

Essentially, tidying up and tucking the sheets in. Apparently, ldoc
was raised in a barn. Who knew?

DOCUMENTATION

# Build our documentation.
ldoc .

# Reset all files to assume unchanged.
ASSUME="git update-index --assume-unchanged"
UNASSUME="git update-index --no-assume-unchanged"

ASSUMED="git ls-files -v | grep ^h | cut -c 3-"
echo $ASSUMED | sh | xargs $UNASSUME

# Find which files have only timestamp as change,
# and mark them as assume unchanged.
STAMP="<i style=\"float:right;\">Last updated.*</i>"
GDIF="git diff --numstat"

$GDIF -G "$STAMP" | egrep '^1\s+1\s' \
    | awk '{ print $3 }'"" | xargs $ASSUME

# Finally, fix GitHub-friendly relative markdown links,
# which ldoc fails to correct when converting to HTML.
find -name *.md.html \
    | xargs perl -pi -e 's/(<a href="[^\"]*\.md)(">)/$1.html$2/g'
